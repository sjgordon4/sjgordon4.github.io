Abstract
	Where is the public art in Madison and who is served by it? We catalogued, photographed, and geotagged 81 permanent, publicly owned, outdoor artworks in Madison, creating a GIS layer from their locations and other attributes. We compared  the distribution of art to socio-economic data and analyzed how far different parts of Madison are from the art. We interviewed a public artist, and did an artwork visual analysis, coding for site setting and theme. 86% of the art is located in and near the isthmus. The majority was art plus utility themed, and the smallest amount was art plus social justice themed. The Madison public is served as viewers, artsy-branded neighborhoods, students art education, cultural tourisms economic benefits, and communities whose issues are addressed. Many artworks and their locations were determined by donors, and one artwork was removed because it functioned as a gathering place for the homeless.<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8LKYyox_VtVdVlrNktvd0tocjQ/view?usp=sharing"><p><br>
